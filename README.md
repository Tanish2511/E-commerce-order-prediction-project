# E-commerce-order-prediction-project

## Overview
This project aims to predict order patterns in an e-commerce setting using machine learning techniques. The dataset used for analysis is the Amazon sales dataset, which contains information about various orders placed on the Amazon platform.

## Dataset
The dataset comprises sales data from Amazon, including attributes such as order ID, date, status, fulfillment method, sales channel, product details, quantity, currency, amount, shipping details, and more. It provides valuable insights into customer purchasing behavior and order fulfillment processes.

## Project Phases
1. **Data Loading and Exploration**: In this phase, we'll load the dataset, explore its structure, and perform initial data analysis to understand the underlying patterns and relationships.

2. **EDA (Exploratory Data Analysis)**: Here, we'll conduct in-depth exploratory data analysis, including visualizations, statistical summaries, and feature engineering to gain insights into the dataset.

3. **Machine Learning Models**: In the final phase, we'll develop machine learning models to predict e-commerce order patterns based on the insights gained from the exploratory analysis. We'll evaluate the performance of various models and choose the most suitable one for deployment.

## Tools and Libraries Used
- Python
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn
